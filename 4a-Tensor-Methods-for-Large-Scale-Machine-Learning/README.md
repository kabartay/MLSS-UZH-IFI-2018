# Tensor Methods for Large Scale Machine-Learning

Tensors, or multi-way arrays, are a generalisation of the concept of matrix to higher dimensions and can encode higher order relationships in data. This course will provide a practical introduction to tensor methods, tensor decomposition and regression, and how to combine tensor methods with Deep Learning. We will demonstrate practical implementation of the algorithms in Python, with TensorLy and PyTorch.

Bio: Jean Kossaifi's research interests are primarily focused on the areas of machine learning, computer vision and pattern recognition, with applications in human-computer interaction and facial affect estimation. He is particularly interested in tensor methods and how to combine them with deep learning. He is currently a Research Assistant at Imperial College London where he finishes his PhD this summer. He has been a visiting researcher in Oregon State University, and most recently Scientist at Amazon AI in Palo Alto, California, working on tensor methods. Jean also holds an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London, a French Engineering Diploma/MSc in applied mathematics, finance and computing, as well as a BSc in Advanced Mathematics.
