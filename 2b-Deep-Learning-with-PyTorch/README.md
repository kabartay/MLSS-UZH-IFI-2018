# Deep Learning with Py Torch

This course will first provide a general introduction to deep learning and its relation to classical machine learning. We will then look at techniques and concepts specific to the design of large-scale computation-intensive models, and illustrate these notions with examples in the PyTorch framework.

Lecturer: [Francois Fleuret](http://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/index.html)

Bio: François Fleuret got a PhD in Mathematics from INRIA and the University of Paris VI in 2000, and an Habilitation degree in Mathematics from the University of Paris XIII in 2006. He is the head of the Machine Learning group at the Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland, since 2007, and adjunct faculty at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) since 2011, where he teaches machine learning. He has published more than 80 papers in peer-reviewed international conferences and journals. He is Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) since 2012, served as Area Chair for NIPS (2012, 2014, 2016, 2017) and ICCV (2012) and in the program committee of many top-tier international conferences in machine learning and computer vision. He is member of the Electrical Engineering Doctoral Program Committee at EPFL, and was or is expert for multiple funding agencies (Swiss National Science Foundation, European Research Council, Austrian Science Fund, Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, French National Research Agency, Research Council of the Academy of Finland, US National Science Foundation). His main research interest is machine learning, with a particular focus on computational aspects and small sample learning, and applications in computer vision.
