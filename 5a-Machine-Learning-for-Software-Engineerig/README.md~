# Machine Learning for Software Engineerig

Our society runs on software systems. From finance, to health, to agriculture, we rely on software systems; it is thus of the utmost importance to be able to do software engineering delivering high quality software with great efficiency. It turns out that machine learning can greatly help with this; indeed software engineering is a very fertile ground for machine learning: Data is collected at every step of the development process and development tasks can be formulated as machine learning problems. In this course, we are going to see how machine learning can be applied to software engineering projects and analyze recent case studies to further understand the techniques and their applications.

Bio: Alberto Bacchelli is SNSF professor in Empirical Software Engineering at UZH where he leads ZEST. His research focus is on developing and applying data science to improve software engineering, with processes, practices, and tools informed by data and actorsâ€™ needs. Prior to joining University of Zurich, Alberto Bacchelli was on the faculty at TU Delft, The Netherlands. He obtained his Ph.D. degree in 2013 at the Faculty of Informatics of the University of Lugano, Switzerland, with a thesis on Mining Unstructured Software Data. He has been research intern twice (2012 and 2013) at Microsoft Research in Redmond, USA. He also worked for CINECA (the largest Italian computing centre, one of the most important worldwide) as a software engineer.
