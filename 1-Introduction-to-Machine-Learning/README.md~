# Introduction to Machine Learning

This course will provide an introduction to basic concepts from supervised and unsupervised machine learning.  We will cover basic approaches to linear and nonlinear classification, regression, clustering and dimension reduction.  We also discuss principles of model selection and validation for optimising predictive performance.  The lectures will be accompanied by interactive demos.
