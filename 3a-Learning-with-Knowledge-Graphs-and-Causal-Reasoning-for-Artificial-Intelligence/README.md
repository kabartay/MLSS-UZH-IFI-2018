# Learning with Knowledge Graphs  and Causal Reasoning for Artificial Intelligence

In the first part I will cover recent work on learning with knowledge graphs. In the second part I will cover the two main causal theories of relevance for AI: Pearl's theory of causal and counterfactual inference and Rubin's causal model.

Lecturer: [Prof. Dr. Volker Tresp](http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/)

Bio: Volker Tresp received a Diploma degree from the University of Goettingen, Germany, in 1984 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University, New Haven, CT, in 1986 and 1989 respectively. Since 1989 he is the head of various research teams in machine learning at Siemens, Research and Technology.  He filed more than 70 patent applications and was inventor of the year of Siemens in 1996. He has published more than 150 scientific articles and administered over 20 Ph.D. theses. The company Panoratio is a spin-off out of his team.  His research focus in recent years has been „Machine Learning in Information Networks“ for modelling Knowledge Graphs, medical decision processes and sensor networks. He is the coordinator of one of the first nationally funded Big Data projects for the realization of „Precision Medicine“.   Since 2011 he is also a Professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he teaches an annual course on Machine Learning.
